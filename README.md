To-do Application (React):**

**Overview**

The To-do Application is a simple and intuitive task management app built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app aims to help users stay organized by providing a clean interface for managing their daily tasks and to-do lists.

Edit Tasks: Modify task descriptions if needed.
Persistent Data (local storage): Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after the app is refreshed.
Responsive Design: The app works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

                      ** Tech Stack **

Challenges Faced:**

State Management with React: Managing the state of tasks, including adding, editing, deleting, and toggling completion, required careful handling of the React state. It was important to ensure the UI was updated dynamically whenever a task was modified.

Local Storage Management: Persisting the tasks in the browser's local storage was an essential feature to make the app more useful. Handling data retrieval and updates from local storage without losing information after refreshing the page was a challenging but rewarding task.

Task Editing: Allowing users to edit tasks added complexity to the state management. It was important to ensure that editing tasks updated both the state and the local storage correctly.

Future Improvements****:

User Authentication: Adding login functionality to allow users to manage their tasks securely.
Task Due Dates: Implementing due dates for tasks and providing reminders.
Task Prioritization: Allowing users to prioritize tasks by adding categories or tags.
Styling Enhancements: Making the user interface more visually appealing by adding animations or more advanced styles.
